Why this Chrome Extension exists?
When I created this extension, its purpose was:

An attempt to save myself from GoT (Game of Thrones) spoilers
To solve the problem of spoilers as a Software Developer
To learn how to creat kick-ass Chrome Extensions
Can I contribute?
Ofcourse! I will be shocked to see a notification saying User {xyz} created a Pull Request.
I promise to approve the PR first, and only then review it.
